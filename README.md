**CretCom Exam Seating App**
----------------------------

**_Problem:_**
Students currently check their exam room allocation manually, which is time-consuming and often causes heavy rush at notice boards. I personally faced this issue—there was a huge crowd trying to check room numbers, I lost a lot of time, and as a result, I arrived late and was not allowed to enter the exam hall. To prevent this from happening to other students, I have created a simple solution that reduces manual effort and ensures students can check their exam room allocations quickly and efficiently.

**_Solution:_**
This Flutter app fetches student data directly from a Google Sheet using the student ID and displays the assigned room number, bench, and course details.

**_What it does:_**
Connects to Google Sheets to fetch student exam allocation.

=> Shows StudentID, StudentName, CourseCode, CourseName, Department, Section, RoomNo, BenchNo

Simple and easy-to-use interface.

Works on Android devices.
